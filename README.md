# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kamii (Hashim Zulkifli)  
ðŸŽ¯ **Aspiring SOC Analyst | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Malware Analysis Learner**  

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an aspiring **SOC Analyst** with a focus on **threat hunting** and **cloud security**. My passion lies in **malware analysis**, **Linux hardening**, and safeguarding digital environments.  

### ðŸ’» **What I'm Working On**  
- **Cybersecurity Labs**: Exploring threat hunting, malware analysis, and security operations.  
- **Cloud Security Path**: Learning tools and strategies for securing cloud environments.  
- **SOC Tools**: Setting up and exploring **Splunk** and other SOC software.  
- **Google Cybersecurity Portfolio Projects**: Showcasing the hands-on projects Iâ€™ve completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. [_here_](https://github.com/KAmii-cxo/Google-Cybersecurity-Certs-Projects)

### ðŸ’» Hands-On Labs
- ***Malware Analysis***: Basic static and dynamic analysis with tools like PE-bear and PEstudio. [_here_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19guyZxUA1wlEPnfp9a9CTzwqDk9kUGHA?usp=drive_link)
- ***Virtualized Environments***: 
  -  Safely setting up and managing malware analysis labs (OS, Ubuntu etc) . The configuration takes a lot of time. I will share it again for the next sandboxing for other OS (packed by SOC course path right now) [_here_]
  -  Network Monitoring and IDS Server conf [_here_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RSOSt8RlBUPyBMuVYi8e5aK3L0ULndsW?usp=drive_link)
- ***Python Projects for automation***: (excited to share about this!)
-  I'm trying to give proper documentation of my jounrney doing other labs too. right now racing against time to do SOC courses path in a proper way. All of the hand-on projects that I documented are in google drive directory. [_here_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sW4_92HpIKTx5grm9TDgcOn4ZMe2RdG6?usp=drive_link).

### Governance Compliance Checklist
-  ***PDPA 2021 Singapore Compliance Checklist*** [_here_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EgwS1RGncc71n3xbSfgWu89dw4WgaxXghDm9xH8x33w/edit?usp=drive_link)
-  I am interested to dig deeper in this area because I think by doing some self-checklist, it can helps me more in future. I am interested to study other rules and regulations of personal data to respective states. Perhaps, i can study and get more understanding in this field. 

### ðŸ›  **Skills & Tools**  
- **Cybersecurity**: Vulnerability scanning, malware analysis, log and network monitoring analysis, incident handling and documentation.  
- **Technical Skills**: Linux, Python, SQL, and hands-on experience with tools like PEstudio, Procmons, and Wireshark.
- **Threat hunting and digital forensics** : Using tools in SIEM and sandboxing to find hiding threats, patterns, behaviour. 
- **Virtualization**: Using VMware, VirtualBox, and REMnux for secure analysis environments.
- **Hacking**: Basic penetration skills and tools using Kali Linux, Metasploit, automation scripts.  

### ðŸ“– **Continuous Learning**  
I'm on an exciting journey to deepen my knowledge and contribute to the cybersecurity field. I recently earned the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, and Iâ€™m working on labs to sharpen my skills further.
