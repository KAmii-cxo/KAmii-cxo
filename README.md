# 👋 Hi, I'm Kamii (Hashim Zulkifli)

Cybersecurity Lab Builder | Threat Hunter | SOC Simulation Specialist  
I simulate real-world attacks, hunt for persistence, and build detection strategies — one lab at a time.

### 🎭 [SOC Lab 03 – Phishing to Malware Analysis + Blue Team Detection](https://github.com/KAmii-cxo/SOC-Lab-03-Phishing-to-Malware-Analysis)
Status : In Progress 🚧

- End-to-end simulation: phishing → malware dropper → reverse shell  
- JavaScript-based cloaking + sandbox/redirection evasion  
- Obfuscation, LOLBins, and persistence techniques (registry, startup, tasks)  
- Detection via Sysmon, Wazuh, YARA, and Sigma  
- Reverse engineering with Ghidra, FlareVM, x64dbg  
- Full MITRE ATT&CK mapping and remediation simulation
