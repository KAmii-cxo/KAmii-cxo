# 👋 Hi, I'm Kamii (Hashim Zulkifli)

Cybersecurity Lab Builder | Threat Hunter | SOC Simulation Specialist  
I simulate real-world attacks, hunt for persistence, and build detection strategies — one lab at a time.

## 🌐 OSI Layer Simulation Series (Red & Blue Team Labs)
Status : Draft 

A tactical simulation series based on the **OSI Model** — covering attack surfaces, security strategies, and detection mapping from Layer 1 to Layer 7.

| Layer | Focus Area | Simulation | Blue Team Focus | Status |
|-------|------------|------------|------------------|--------|
| Layer 1 – Physical | Device Access | USB payload injection, rogue access | Physical hardening checklist | ⏳ Drafting |
| Layer 2 – Data Link | MAC spoofing, ARP poisoning | ARP cache poisoning in LAN | Detection with ARPwatch + alerts | ⏳ In Progress |
| Layer 3 – Network | IP spoofing, ICMP tunneling | Covert channels, ping tunnel | Firewall, anomaly detection | ✅ Completed (notes) |
| Layer 4 – Transport | Port scanning, reverse shell | Nmap, Netcat, TCP bind/rev shell | Wazuh + Sysmon correlation | ✅ Lab ready |
| Layer 5 – Session | MITM session hijacking | Credential harvesting in transit | TLS inspection + logging | ⏳ Drafting |
| Layer 6 – Presentation | Encoding & obfuscation | Base64, XOR payloads | YARA, Sigma, decoding rules | ✅ Included in Lab 02 |
| Layer 7 – Application | Web exploits, phishing | XSS, JS dropper, credential dump | WAF + log correlation | ✅ Integrated in Lab 03 |

> This series will expand continuously — with detection engineering at every layer.
